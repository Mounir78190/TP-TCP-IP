## 1. Introduction :

This lab focuses on the practical understanding of TCP/IP and UDP protocols in modern networks. The main objectives are to demonstrate configuration, troubleshooting, and analysis of communication protocols, including complementary protocols such as DHCP and ARP. This README serves as a reference for reproducing exercises and solving encountered issues.

## 3. Issues Encountered and Solutions

### Issue 1: IP Address Conflict
* Description: IP address conflict error when configuring a static IP.
* Solution: Checked the network for other devices using the same IP address and reconfigured it with an available address.
  
### Issue 2: No Wireshark for Packet Capture
* Description: Unable to use Wireshark on Cisco.
* Solution: Used Ciscoâ€™s network simulator, which provides a visual representation of packet behavior.

## 4. Theoretical Analysis

The TCP/IP protocol is fundamental for modern networks, enabling interoperability between different systems.
* TCP ensures reliable, ordered transmission with error control, making it suitable for applications where accuracy is critical, such as web browsing and emails.
* UDP, on the other hand, offers faster, connectionless transmission, making it ideal for real-time applications like video streaming and online gaming.

## 5. Conclusion

This practical lab strengthened our understanding of TCP/IP and UDP protocols, including their configurations and troubleshooting techniques.
Hands-on experience, combined with theoretical knowledge, significantly improved our grasp of network connectivity and performance.
